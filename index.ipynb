    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will look at a brief introduction to the Statistical Learning Theory and some key components in the framework of this theory. The is a particularly important theory as it encompasses majority of statistical inference and functional analyses approaches that we will come across later in the course. Statistical learning theory has led to successful applications in fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, bio-informatics and sports etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand and describe the statistical learning theory \n",
    "* Understand dependent and independent variables as key components of statistical learning approaches\n",
    "* Give an introduction on model development and model parameters\n",
    "* Demonstrate a basic understanding of ideas of model loss and model validation\n",

    "## Statistical Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "> Statistical learning theory is a framework for machine learning drawing from the fields of statistics and functional analysis. Statistical learning theory deals with the problem of finding a predictive function based on data. **The goal of statistical learning theory is to study, in a statistical framework, the properties of learning algorithms.**\n",

    "\n",
    "Conventionally, the independent variable goes on the x-axis, or the horizontal axis. For the height-weight data that we saw in earlier labs, a scatter plot may look as shown below. Here we have set height as independent and weight as a dependent variable i.e. **we want to study if height has some effect on weight**:\n",

    "\n",
    "For the plot we see above, the relationship between height and weight can be shown using a **straight line** connecting all the individual observations in the data. So this line here would be our **model** as shown in the image below. \n",

    "## Model Generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "As the data which is available to us for modeling is finite Data is finite, the available data needs to be used very efficiently to build and **validate** a model. Validation of the model usually makes the model more **Generalizable** for unseen situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Training the model is like infancy stage for humans. Examples are presented to the model and the model tweaks its  parameters to better understand the data. Once the training is over, the model is unleashed upon new data and then uses what it has learned to explain that data.  This is where problems can emerge. If we **over-train** the model on the training data i.e. make the model every detail of shown data, it will be able to identify all the relevant information in the training data, but will fail miserably when presented with the new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then say that the **model is incapable of generalizing**, or that **model is over-fitting the training data**. \n",

    "The top three diagrams we have data and models (dashed curves). From left to right the models have been trained longer and longer on the training data. The training error curve in the bottom box shows that the training error gets better and better as we train longer (increasing model complexity). You may think that if we train longer we'll get better! Well, yes, but **only better at describing the training data**. The top right box shows a very complex model that hits all the data points. This model does great on the training data, but when presented with new data (examine the Prediction error curve in the bottom box) then it does abysmally. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create good predictive models in machine learning that are capable of generalizing, one needs to know when to stop training the model so that it doesn't over-fit.\n",

    "If the model can not figure out the underlying relationship between independent and dependent variable(s), the loss function outputs a very high number. Consider the weight-height example above, we can see the linear model is not exactly touching each data point because these points do not exist in a line. the individual distance of each point from the line is **loss** that the model exhibits. \n",

    "Below is an example loss function known as **Sum of Squares** loss. This calculates a loss for fitting straight line to set of variables (as in our case above) and measure the distance between data points and line to measure the level of LOSS. \n",
